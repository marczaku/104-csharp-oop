## 2. Structured Programming
- Programs are divided into functions and data
- Functions
  - Require Data as Input
  - Return Data as Output
- Data
  - Only stores information
- Separation of Data and Functions
```cs
class House {
  bool isOpen;
  Color color;
}

static void OpenHouseDoor(House house) {
  house.isOpen = true;
}

static void CloseHouseDoor(House house) {
  house.isOpen = false;
}

static void SetHouseColor(House house, Color color) {
  house.color = color;
}

static Color GetHouseColor(House house) {
  return house.color;
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  House house = new Houe();
  OpenHouseDoor(house);
  CloseHouseDoor(house);
  SetHouseColor(house, Color.Red);
  Color color = GetHouseColor(1);
}
```



---

## 3. Object-Oriented

- Programs are divided into objects
- Objects contain functions and data

```cs
class House {
  bool isDoor Open;
  
  public void OpenDoor() {
    this.isDoorOpen = true;
  }

  public void CloseDoor() {
     this.isDoorOpen = true;
  }
  
  public Color color { get; set;}
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  var house = new House();
  house.OpenDoor();
  house.CloseDoor();
  house.Color = Color.Red;
  Color color = house.Color;
}
```


---

## 4. Classes & Objects

- You can define a class using this syntax:
```cs
public class classs-name {
  class-body
}
```

- Classes are types. Basically Templates for Objects
- The class below contains one `public` `instance` Method
  - It is called `MakeSound`
  - And will become a part of `Animal` instances
- More on that later

```cs
// This defines a new class
public class Animal {
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("...");
  }
}
```

- Objects are instances of those classes
- Create instances using `new` keyword
- And storing the return value in a variable
- Or pass it on to another method

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  // This creates an instance of the class Animal
  Animal myPet = new Animal();
```

- You can use object instances to call its members.\
- In this case, the `Animal` Class has one `instance` Member:
  - The Method `void MakeSound()`

```cs
  // This calls the instances method. 
  myPet.MakeSound(); // Output:"..."
```

You can create multiple instances of the same class:

```cs
  // This creates another instance of the same class
  // It has it's own method, with the same result: Output: "..."
  var yourPet = new Animal();
  yourPet.MakeSound();
```

- To destroy instances, just forget about them
- The feature that takes care of destroying "forgotten" objects, is called `Garbage Collector`, or hort `GC`
- `null` is the keyword for „No Instance“

```cs
  // To destroy an instance, we just need to forget about it
  // The garbage collector will do the rest:
  yourPet = null;
}
```

---

## 5. Class Members

Class Members are parts of the class.\
There can be, as we have seen earlier, methods as class Members.\
Syntax: `public ReturnTyp MethodName() {}`\
Member methods are methods that belong to class instances:

```cs
public class Animal {
  // This is a member method of class Animal
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("...");
  }
}
```

We can then invoke that Method on instances of the class:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal dog = new Animal();
  // we can invoke member methods on the instance:
  dog.MakeSound(); // Output: ...
}
```

Also, there can be fields as class Member.\
Syntax: `public FieldType fieldName;`\
Field are basically variables that belong to a class instance:

```cs
public class Animal {
  // This is a member field of class Animal
  public string name;
}
```

We can use the field on instances of that class:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal dog = new Animal();
  // we can assign values to member fields on the instance:
  dog.name = "Bello";
  // and we can read values from the instance:
  Console.WriteLine(dog.name); // Output: Bello
}
```

We can also combine member methods and fields.\
This allows us to acces an instance's field from an instance's method:

```cs
public class Animal {
  public string name;
  public void MakeSound() {
    // here, we can access this animal's name-field:
    Console.WriteLine(name + ":...");
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {

  // Create a new Animal instance
  var adam = new Animal();
  // Assign the name "Adam" to this Animal instance
  adam.name = "Adam";
  
  // Create another Animal instance
  var eva = new Animal();
  // Assign the name "Eve" to this second Animal instance
  eva.name = "Eva";
  
  // This calls the MakeSound-method on the instance
  // On which we set the name to Adam
  adam.MakeSound(); // Output: "Adam:..."
  
  // And this one calls it on the animal with the name Eva
  eva.MakeSound(); // Output: "Eva:..."
}
```

---

## 6. Static Class Members

- Static class members are part of the class-type
- And not part of the instances
- To access them, you use the class‘s type name instead of an instance
  - Static Field: `public static FieldType fieldName;`
  - Static Method: `public static ReturnType MethodName() {}`

```cs
public class Animal {
  public string name;
  // This is a static field
  public static int count;
  
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine(name + ":...");
  }
  
  // This is a static method
  static static void PrintCount() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal-Count: " + count);
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  var adam = new Animal();
  adam.name = "Adam";
  // Static fields are accessed using the type name
  Animal.Count++;
  
  var eva = new Animal();
  eva.name = "Eva";
  Animal.Count++;
  
  // Static methods are accessed using the type name
  
  Animal.PrintCount(); // Output: "Animal-Count: 2"
  
  // Non-static mathods require an instance to be called
  eva.MakeSound(); // Output: "Eva:..."
}
```


- You can even mark a complete class as `static`
  - Only, if all Members are marked `static`, too!
  - This will force you to make all members `static`, too!


```cs
// This is a static class:
public static class Math{
  public static int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

```cs
// ERROR: A static class cannot have instance members:
public static class Math{
  public int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

It will disable using the `new` keyword to create instances of this class

```cs
public static void Main() {
  // ERROR: This is not possible:
  Math math = new Math();
}
```

Once more, to compare, for a class named `Tree`:

-| static | instance
 :--: | :--: | :--:
keyword | `static` | none (default)
define a field | `public static int count;` | `public int height;`
write to a field | `Tree.count = 5;` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); tree.height = 5;`
read a field | `int i = Tree.count;` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); int i = tree.height;`
define a method | `public static string PrintDefinition(){}` | `public void DoPhotosynthesis(){}`
use a method | `Tree.PrintDefinition();` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); tree.DoPhotosynthesis();`

Now, you probably wonder:\
When to use `static` and when not to?

The question you need to ask for Fields:
Is the Field, that you want to add, something you want every instance to own by itself? e.g.:
- a house's color (one Houe might be red, another one blue)
- a person's name (one person is called Max, another one Anna)
- a unit's health (one unit might have full health, the other one might be almost dead)
Then make it an intance field.

Is the Field something that is shared across all instances of a class? e.g.:
- a counter for how many enemies have been spawned
- a global buff that is applied to all units (like 10% extra damage for everyone)
Then make it a static field.

Do you want to easily access this information globally, because you need it only in one place, e.g.:
- a timer, how long the game still lasts
- the current score of the player
- the information, whether the game is paused
Then you can also make it a static field (at least for now, I will later strongly discourage you of using static fields)

The question you can ask for Methods:
Does the Method require any information from a class's instance? e.g.:
- The `TakeDamage`-Method needs to access a spawned unit's `health`
- The `Attack`-Method needs sto know, who is attacking, and how much damage the attacker can deal
- The `SetPosition`-Method needs to set a certain GameObject's position
Then you want to use an instance Method

Is the Method a very Generic Method, that works independent of an instance of a class? e.g.:
- Any `Math`-function; Mathematical functions don't need to know, who wants to add two numbers, the result will be the same
- A Method that can calculate a path between to locations in an RTS
Then make the method static. Usually, static functions are really used for Calculations and Formulas only


---

## 7. Constructor
```cs
public class Cat {
// Classes have default constructors like: public Cat() {/*nothing*/}
}

public class Elephant {
  bool has Trunk;
  // You can define your own constructor without parameters to do initialization

  publlic Elephant() {
    this.hasTrunk = true;
  }
}

public class Dog {
string name;
  // or you can create a constructor with parameters
  // making it impossible to create an instance without
  
  public Dog(string name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

static voic Main(string[] args) {
  var car = new Cat();
  var elephant = new Elephant();
  var dog = new Dog();
  // This above is not possible! As soon as we define a constructor,
  // the default constructor disappears!
  dog = new Dog();
}
```
- Constructors are called when a class is constructed through the `new` key-word
- There‘s an invisible Parameterless Default-Constructor for every class doing nothing
- It disappears as soon as you define your own Constructor!
- You can define your own Constructor like a method
- Without return type (not even `void`)
- Syntax: `public ClassName() { }` 
- Note:
  - You can use it for initializing values
  - Or for requiring parameters
  - Those HAVE TO be passed with the `new` keyword

---

## 8. Finalizer
```cs
public class Animal {
  // Constructor
  
  public Animal() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal destroyed.");
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  for ( var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // This will call the Constructor
    var animal = new Animal();
    // At this point, the loop will start again
    // The old animal variable will not be out of scope
    // And therefore cleaned up by the garbage collector at some point
    // This will call the finalizer
    // To speed this process up, since the garbage collector is slow and lazy
    // We can call it manually:
    GC.Collect();
  }
}
```
- Opposite of a constructor
- Defined through `~ClassName()` `{}` Method Signature
- Unreliable (You never know, when it‘s called)
- Dependant on when the Garbage Collector Collects the Object
- Better: IDisposable-Pattern

---

## 9. Access Modifiers
```cs
public class Animal {
// Private is only accessible by this class
// Everything is private per default
  Color color;
// public is accessible by everyone
  public string name;
  // protected is only accessible by this class and inheritors
  protected int age;
  
  public Animal(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public void SetAge(int value) {
    this.age = value;
  }
}
static void Main(string[]args) {
var animal = new Animal(5);
  // ERROR: Cannot access private field
  animal.id = 3;
  // Valid: name is a public field
  animal.name = "Adam";
  // ERROR: cannot access protected field
  animal.age = 5;
  // Valid: SetAge is a public method
  animal.SetAge(5);
}
```
- You can use access modifiers on classes, fields, method, properties
- Just put the access modified before it
- private (default): available to owning class only
- protected: available to owning class and inheritors
- public: available to all classes
- internal: public within all of your own code

---

## 10. Access Modifiers

```cs
public class Circle {
  // radius is private to avoid other classes of assigning invalid values
  double radius;
// area is private to avoid other classes of assigning other values
  double area;
  // SetRadius is a public method that you can use to set the radius
  // It validates the radius and updates the area as well
  public void SetRadius(double radius) {
    if (radius <= 0)
      return;
    this.radius = radius;
    this.area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
  }
// GetRadius is a public method to read the radius
  public double GetRadius() {
    return this.radius;
  }
  // GetArea is a public method to read the area
  public double GetArea() {
    return this.area;
  }
}
```
- Which one to use?
- Make as much use of private as possible
- It offers less confusion to users of your class, if they can only change values that make sense
- It makes your code more easy to change, because other classes can not rely on private fields / methods
- It prevents other classes to „break“ your classes through invalid changes
- Use protected if you use inheritance
- And only, if you expect inheriting classes to need a certain field / method
- Use public for everything you want to make available
- It should be your conscious intention to make sth. public

---

## 11. Properties

```cs
public class Circle {
  // a private field, so it's inaccessible
  int radius;
  // a traditional Setter-Method
  
  public void SetRadius(int value) {
    this.radius = value;
  }
  // a traditional Getter-method
  
  public int GetRadius() {
    return this.radius;
  }
  // a property with the same functionality
  public int Radius {
    get {
      // The getter method has to return to an int
      return this.radius;
    }
    set {
      // The setter method gets a local int "value"
      this.radius = value;
    }
  }
}
```

- Properties are used in `C#` to Replace Getter and Setter Method
- They are basically just syntactic sugar!
- You can define a getter and a setter separately
- `public PropertyType PropertyName {
     get { // a function that returns PropertyType }
     set { // a function that gets a local variable named           
                value of type PropertyType }`

---

## 12. Properties - 2

```cs
public class Circle {
int radius;
// properties may have only a getter
  
  public int Radius {
    get {
      return this.radius;
    }
  }
// or only a setter
  public int Radius1 {
    set
      this.radius = value;
  }
}
// or different access modifiers:
public int Radius2 {
  get {
    return.this.radius;
  }
  private set {
    this.radius = value;
  }
}
// and you can use expression-bodies:
public int Radius3 {
  get => this.radius;
  set => this.radius = value;
  }
}
```
- Since Properties act as two separe methods…
- You may have only a Getter, or only a Setter
- Or your getter may be public
- And your setter private at the same time
- There‘s also a nice expression-body syntax:
  -  get => `referenceToValue;`
  -  set => `referenceToValue = value;`

---

## 13. Properties - 3

```cs
public class Circle {
  // This is an auto-property
  // it stores the value in a hidden field that you cannot access in any other way
  
  public int Radius {
    get;
    private set;
  }
}
// the above class is the same as:
public class AnotherCircle {
  int _radius;
  public int Radius {
    get {
      return this._radius;
    }
    private set {
      this._radius = value;
    }
  }
}
```

- Want to save even more space?
- Use Auto-Properties:
  - They have a hidden field for the value
  - It‘s popular to name a backing field, that‘s supposed to only be changed through a Property with Underscore: _variableName 
  - It signalizes, that it should not be accessed directly; But it does not prevent it (within the class)
