## 1. Methods

Methods are used to group functionality in one place and make it invokable in other places.\
This can be useful in order to have less code to write. Check out this example:

```cs
// this could be UNO card game logic:
if(playerCanPlayNoCards) {
  // if the player can not play any cards, he needs to draw a card
  if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
    Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
  }
  Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
  Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
}

Console.WriteLine("Opponent Turn:");

if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
      Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
    Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
  }
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
      Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
    Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
  }
}
```

That is a lot of code, or?\
How about this?

```cs
static void DrawCard() {
  if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
    Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
  }
  Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
  Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
}

if(playerCanPlayNoCards) {
  DrawCard();
}

Console.WriteLine("Opponent Turn:");

if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    DrawCard();
  }
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    DrawCard();
  }
}
```

What has happened here?
We have taken a big block of code that was in multiple places of our code:
```cs
if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
  Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
}
Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
```

And put it into a method with a name:

```cs
// Define a new method named DrawCard:
static void DrawCard() {
  if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
    Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
  }
  Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
  Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
}
```

Now, we can just call the method whereever we need it:

```cs
if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    // Invoke the method named DrawCard:
    DrawCard();
  }
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    DrawCard();
  }
}
```

You can define a method like this:
- we have to use the `static` keyword here in order to call the function from Main
  - more on this later
- `void` is the return type and basically means 'nothing' is returned
  - more on this later, too
- `SayHello` is the method name
- The paranthesis have to follow after
  - everything between them is an argument to the method - more later
- You put the content (body) of you method between curly brackets `{` and `}`

In this code sample, you can see the order in which code is executed by the comments at the end of the line (`// 1` usw.)

```cs

// One method is defined
static void SayHello() { // 3
  Console.WriteLine("Hello"); // 4
} // 5

// Another method is defined
static void SayGoodbye() { // 6
  Console.WriteLine("Goodbye"); // 7
} // 8

static void Main(string[] args) { // 1
  // Invoke method SayHello
  SayHello(); // 2

  // Invoke Method SayGoodBye
  SayGoodbye(); // 5
  
} // 9
```

You can define a method without return type using the syntax:

```
static void MethodName() {
  method-body
} 
```
 
    
You can invoke a method using the method name and paranthesis:
```
MethodName();
```

## 2. Parameters

### One Parameter

Sometimes, we want to pass information into a method.\
Imagine for example, the previous `DrawCard`-Method:

```cs
static void DrawCard() {
  if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
    Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
  }
  Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
  Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
}

if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    // Invoke the method named DrawCard:
    DrawCard();
  }
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    DrawCard();
  }
}
```

Wouldn't it be cool, if we could just tell the `DrawCard`-method, how many cards need to be drawn?\
Like this:
```cs
DrawCard(2);
```

This is actually, possible, thanks to method arguments;
```cs
static void DrawCard(int number) {
  for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
      Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
    Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
  }
}
```

Now, we can change the method calls:

```cs
if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  // Invoke the method named DrawCard with 2 as an argument
  DrawCard(2);
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  // Invoke the method named DrawCard with 4 as an argument
  DrawCard(4);
}
```

You can define a method with a parameter using this syntax:

```cs
static void MethodName(ParameterType parameter-name) {
  method-body
}```
    
You can invoke a method using the method name and the argument in paranthesis:

```cs
MethodName(argument-value);
```

```cs
static void SayHelloTo(string name) {
  // the name-variable is only valid within the method's scope
  Console.WriteLine("Hello" + name);
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  // This will pass "Mike" as an argument for the parameter name
  // It will pring "Hello Mike"
  SayHelloTo("Mike");
  // This passes "Mike" as an argument, it will print "Bye Mike"
  SayByeTo("Mike");
}
```

In fact, you have been using a method with an argument all this time already:
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World.");
```

This method looks like this:
```cs
static void WriteLine(string value) {
}
```

### Multiple Parameters

A method can also have multiple parameters\
They need to be separated by `,`:

```cs
static void SayHelloTo(string firstName, string lastName) {
  Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName);
}
```

You can invoke that method by passing in the required arguments, separated by `,`:

```cs
// This passes "John" as an argument for "firstName"
// And "Doe" as an argument for "lastName"
// It will print "Hello, John Doe"
SayHelloTo("John", "Doe");
```

The arguments can have different types, of course:
```cs
static void SendInviteTo(string name + int time) {
  Console.Writeline(name + "invited for" + time);
}
```

When invoking this method, you need to pass the correct arguments in correct order:

```cs
// This passes "Mike" as an argument for name and "5" for time
// It will print to "Mike invited for 5"
SendInviteTo("Mike", 5);
```

You cannot pass too few...

```cs
// ERROR: not enough arguments passed to function.
SendInviteTo("Mike");
```

...or too many arguments:

```cs
//ERROR: Too many arguments:
SendInviteTo("Mike", 10, 5);
```

You can not pass the arguments in wrong order, if the types don't match:\
You will get a compile error and not be able to run your code!

```cs
// ERROR: Arguments have to be in the right order:
SendInviteTo(5, "Mike");
```

### Named arguments

If you are afraid that your code is too unreadable or confusing...:

```cs
// what do these arguments stand for?
CreateAppointment(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15);
```

...it is usually means, the method is not well-designed, but let's ignore this for now...
```cs
static void CreateAppointment(int day, int month, int year, int hour, int minute, int duration) {
  // ...
}
```

...you can provide named arguments:

```cs
CreateAppointment(day: 10, month: 11, year: 12, hour: 13, minute: 14, duration: 15);
```

This has the advantage, that it frees you from the order of arguments:

```cs
// this is also legit, even if the order of arguments in the method definition is different:
CreateAppointment(duration: 15, year: 12, month: 11, day: 10, hour: 13, minute: 14);
```

But your arguments need to be named correctly:
```cs
// Compile error: no argument named 'length' exists
CreateAppointment(day: 10, month: 11, year: 12, hour: 13, minute: 14, length: 15);
```

### Optional arguments

Let's take one more look at our previous `DrawCard`-method:

```cs
static void DrawCard(int number) {
  for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
      Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
    Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
  }
}

if(playerCanPlayNoCards) {
  DrawCard(1);
}

Console.WriteLine("Opponent Turn:");

if(opponentCard == "DrawTwo") {
  DrawCard(2);
}
if(opponentCard == "DrawFour") {
  DrawCard(4);
}
```

Isn't it a bit annoying, that we need to write this:
```cs
if(playerCanPlayNoCards) {
  DrawCard(1);
}
```

When we could understand the code just as well, if it just looked like this:
```cs
if(playerCanPlayNoCards) {
  // DrawCard() already makes it quite clear, that only one card is draw. No need to specify that it's 1:
  // But it's invalid, because the method DrawCard() expects one argument of type int...
  // Therefore, we get a compile-error and cannot execute our code.
  DrawCard();
}
```

We can make the parameter optional by using the syntax:
```cs
ArgumentType argument-name = defaultValue
```

This would look like this:
```cs
// Default value 1:
static void DrawCard(int number = 1) {
  for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if(cardStackIsEmpty) {
      Console.WriteLine("Mixing cards back into the deck...");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Taking a random card...");
    Console.WriteLine("... and adding it to player's hand.");
  }
}
```

Now, if we call this:
```cs
DrawCard(3);
```

Then the default value is not used, and three cards are drawn.

If we call it without an argument, though:
```cs
DrawCard();
```

Then, the default argument `number = 1` is used, and one card is drawn.

---

## 3. Return Type

Sometimes, we want our methods not to be able to get passed information into it...\

```cs
static void DrawCard(int number) {
}
```

...but to be able to return information back to the caller:

```cs
string aiCoordinate = GetRandomCoordinate(); // returns e.g. "f3", or "a1", or "d5"
```

This can be accomplished quite easily. First, we need to change our method signature from `void`:

```cs
static void GetRandomCoordinate() {
}
```

To the type that we want to return, in this case `string`:

```cs
static string GetRandomCoordinate() {
  // Compile Error: not all code paths return a value
}
```

But to satisfy the Compiler, we also need to make sure, that we actually return a value:
```cs
static string GetRandomCoordinate() {
  return letters[random.Next(10)] + random.Next(10);
}
```

We can now just call the method and do nothing with the return value:
```cs
static void Main(string [] args) {
  // This returns a string, but we can just ignore it:
  GetRandomCoordinate();
}
```

Or, we can assign the return value to a variable:

```cs
static void Main(string [] args) {
  // This returns a string that we save to a variable:
  string aiChoice = GetRandomCoordinate();
}
```

Or, we can pass on the return value right into the next method:

```cs
static void Main(string [] args) {
  // This returns a string that is then passed as an argument to WriteLine
  Console.WriteLine(GetRandomCoordinate());
}
```

Of course, you have been using a method with return value all this time already:

```cs
string playerInput = Console.ReadLine();
```

This method has this signature:

```cs
string Readline() {
  // c# magic
}
```

## 4. Return

- You can use `return` within `void`-Methods as well.
- If you use `return` (without any value) within `void` methods, the method will stop executing right away.
- It will basically jump to the last `}` of the method and `return` to whatever method was called before.
- If the method has a return-type other than `void` however, you need to provide a value to the `return`-statement

```cs
static void Main() { // 1
  Console.WriteLine("What's you age?"); // 2
  var age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); // 3
  if (age < 18); { // 4
    Console.WriteLine("This software is not avaliable under the age of 18!"); // 5
    // This will return from then main method ( straight to // 17)
    // Therefore, lines // 6 until // 16 will not be executed anymore
    return; // 6
  } // 7

  // This code will only be executed, if the return in line // 6 was not executed
  Console.WriteLine("Congrats, you are old enough"); // 8
  int i = 0; // 9
  while (true) { // 10
    i++; // 11
    if (i == 5) { // 12
      // You can use return within loops as well (straight to // 17)
      // It will return from the main method completely, not only break the loop
      return; // 13
    } // 14
  } // 15
  // This line of code will never be executed, because the return in // 13 will always be hit first
  Console.WriteLine("This line of code can never happen."); // 16
} // 17
```


---

## 5. Code Paths

The tricky part is, that all your code path need to return a value,\
if your method has a return type other than `void`:

```cs
static string GetAgeGroup(int age) {
  if(age < 13) {
    return "Child";
  }
  else if(age < 20) {
    return "Teenager";
  }
  
  // Compile ERROR: Not all code paths return a value;
  // What, if the age is 28, for example?
  // What is returned then?
}
```

This is valid however:

```cs
static string GetAgeGroup(int age) {
  if(age < 13) {
    return "Child";
  }
  else if(age < 20) {
    return "Teenager";
  }
  else {
    return "Adult";
  }
  // Valid, C# is smart enough to know, that one of these cases will always return
}
```

This is not valid:

```cs
static string GetAgeGroup(int age) {
  if(age < 13) {
    // ERROR: if age i < 13, then nothing is returned
  } else {
    return "I don't know.";
  }
```

But this is:

```cs
static string GetAgeGroup(int age) {
  if(age < 13) {
    return "Child";
  }
  // Since the if case above would already return, we don't need else-if:
  if(age < 20) {
    return "Teenager";
  }
  // Since the if case above would already return, we don't need else:
  return "Adult";
}
```

It cannot happen, that a method returns multiple value through multiple `return`-statements...\
...since the first `return`-statement will interrupt the method right away:

```cs
static string GetAgeGroup(int age) {
  return "Child"; // will always return
  return "Teenager"; // will never be called
  return "Adult"; // will never be called
}
```

---

## 6. Overloading

- You can define multiple functions with the same name
```cs
// You can define multiple methods with the same name:
static int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- They need to have different count and / or types of arguments, though.
```cs
static float Add(float a, float b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The return types can be the same
```cs
static float Add(double a, double b) {
  return (float) a + (float) b;
}
```

Using identical method name and set of arguments will lead to compile errors:\
If there is any ambiguity your program will not compile!
```cs
// ERROR: "Method with the same signature Add(double, double) is already declared"
static double Add(double a, double b) {
  return (float) a + (float) b;
}
```

The compiler will know, which function to call, by determining which method accepts the arguments that you provided

You have also been using this feature extensively already.\
Have you not been wondering, why these method calls were both valid?

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine(5);
```

This is, because multiple overloads for the same method exist:

```cs
void Writeline(string value) {
  // ...
}
void WriteLine(int value) {
  // ...
}
// and many more
```
