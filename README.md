# 104 - CSharp OOP

## Goal

This course focuses on the features of C# that allow Object-Oriented-Programming. It will teach about classes, fields, properties and methods and object-oriented-programming principles.

Check out the [Scoring Table](5-game-on) to understand, what grade to expect depending on the features that you've implemented:

# 0 First Steps
- [ ] Start the [Assignment on Google and GitHub Classroom](https://gist.github.com/marczaku/3b1853ee30575093b106ecc480d563b2).

# 1 Classes
## Goal
We'll learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and how to define and instantiate a class and how to customize it with Fields and Methods.

[Let's Get Started!](1-classes)

# 2 Encapsulation
## Goal
Encapsulation allows us to restrict access to internal data (fields) and functions (methods) of classes and how this feature enables us to validate input, ensure the integrity of the internals of our class and even do complex calculations every time an information is requested.

[Let's Get Started!](2-encapsulation)

# 3 Inheritance
## Goal
Inheritance allow us to share code between classes by putting it into a common base class. It allows for very useful code principles as polymorphism, which ensure that we can write code for all classes that share a common ancestor.

[Let's Get Started!](3-inheritance)

# 4 Abstraction
## Goal
Loops allow us to repeat the same instructions 100 times or even a million times. But how can we store 100 or even a million variables? The answer is: using Arrays. We'll learn about what Arrays are and how to use them to store and read information from them.

[Let's Get Started!](4-abstraction)

# 4 Game On
## Goal
Continue working on the RPG Project and implement all of the required features.
