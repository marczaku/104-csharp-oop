# Slides 3 - Inheritance

Inheritance allow us to share code between classes by putting it into a common base class. It allows for very useful code principles as polymorphism, which ensure that we can write code for all classes that share a common ancestor.

## 9. Inheritance 

### Example without Inheritance

Look at the following classes:

```cs
public class Dog {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Dog(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} walks.");}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

```cs
public class Fish {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Fish(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

```cs
public class Parrot {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Parrot(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flys.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

```cs
public class Chicken {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(5);
Fish fish = new Fish(2);
Parrot parrot = new Parrot(7);
Chicken chicken = new Chicken(3);

dog.Breathe();
dog.Walk();
dog.Swim();

fish.Breathe();
fish.Swim();

parrot.Breathe();
parrot.Fly();
parrot.Walk();

chicken.Breathe();
chicken.Fly();
chicken.Walk();
```

Output:
```
Dog age 5 brithes.
Dog age 5 walks.
Dog age 5 swims.
Fish age 2 brithes.
Fish age 2 swims.
Parrot age 7 brithes.
Parrot age 7 flys.
Parrot age 7 swims.
Chicken age 3 brithes.
Chicken age 3 flies.
Chicken age 3 swims.
```

### The Problem without Inheritance

That's a couple of classes and each of them has some similar and some different Methods. But we have a lot of duplication, don't we? It might not be so obvious, because each of these Methods is only one line long. But later, these Methods might grow into 20 or 70 or 300 lines of code each!

Have you noticed the awful spelling error? `brithes` instead of `breathes`?\
How many lines of code do we need to change that error? - 4. Once in every class. :(

Also, have you noticed, that in Parrot, it spells `flys` and in Chicken it spells `flies`?\
Which one is correct? In this case that's not the important part. The important part is that we have contradictory information in our code. One time, we spell it one way and the other time another.

### DRY Principle

Both above problems are the reason, why in Programming, we need to follow the DRY Principle actively!

- **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself!

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to put Members that different classes have in common into a common base class. That base class needs to have a proper name.

e.g. in above example, all classes have a `Breathe()`-Method and an `Age`-Property. and all classes happen to be animals.

This allows us to introduce a base-class:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
}
```

And now, we can look at other classes, e.g.:

```cs
public class Fish {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Fish(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

And have them inherit from class `Animal` and thereby inheriting all of `Animal`'s Members (`Age` and `void Breathe()`):

```cs
public class Fish : Animal {
  public Fish(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

The class `Fish` still has all of its Members:

```cs
Fish fish = new Fish(2);
fish.Breathe();
fish.Swim();
Console.WriteLine(fish.Age);
```

Output:
```
Fish age 2 brithes.
Fish age 2 swims.
2
```

Same goes for other classes, e.g. `Dog`. Before:

```cs
public class Dog {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Dog(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} walks.");}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

After:

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} walks.");}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

We can take it even further: e.g. `Dog`, `Parrot` and `Chicken` are all terrestrial animals, which can `void Walk()`. And every terrestrial animal is an `Animal` as well:

```cs
public class Terrestrial : Animal {
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} walks.");}
}
```

This reduces e.g. the `Chicken` from:

```cs
public class Chicken {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

over

```cs
public class Chicken : Animal {
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

to:

```cs
public class Chicken : Terrestrial {
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
}
```

And the `Dog` is now:

```cs
public class Dog : Terrestrial {
  public Dog(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
```

And while we're at it, `Chicken` and `Parrot` are both birds, which are terrestrial animals, which are animals:

```cs
public class Bird : Terrestrial {
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
}
```

Which reduces the `Chicken` class further to:

```cs
public class Chicken : Bird {
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
}
```

Final code sample:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} brithes.");}
}
public class Terrestrial : Animal {
  public void Walk(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} walks.");}
}
public class Bird : Terrestrial {
  public void Fly(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} flies.");}
}
public class Dog : Terrestrial {
  public Dog(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
public class Fish : Animal {
  public Fish(int age){Age = age;}
  public void Swim(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} swims.");}
}
public class Parrot : Bird {
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
}
public class Chicken : Bird {
  public Chicken(int age){Age = age;}
}
```

Which makes it a lot easier to fix the spelling error in `void Breathe()`:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public void Breathe(){Console.WriteLine($"{this} age {Age} breathes.");} // not brithes!!
}
```

### Limitation of Inheritance

Problem is: Both the `Dog` and the `Fish` can Swim. But the `Dog` can walk, just like the `Bird`s, while the `Fish` can't...

So either the `Dog` inherits from `Terrestrial`, so he can share the `Walk()`-Method with the birds:

```cs
class Animal{} // breathe
class Fish : Animal {} // swim (breathe)
class Terrestrial : Animal{} // walk (breathe)
class Dog : Terrestrial{} // swim (walk, breathe)
class Bird : Terrestrial{} // fly (walk, breathe)
```

Or the `Dog` could inherit from some `Aquatic` class shared with the `Fish`, but then the `Dog` can't share the ability to `Walk()` with the `Bird`s anymore:

```cs
class Animal{} // breathe
class Aquatic : Animal {} // swim (breathe)
class Terrestrial : Animal{} // walk (breathe)
class Fish : Aquatic {} // -- (swim, breathe)
class Dog : Aquatic{} // walk (swim, breathe)
class Bird : Terrestrial{} // fly (walk, breathe)
```

The only chance to share the ability to `Walk()` with both the `Dog` and the `Bird`s would be by putting it in the `Animal`-class. But then, the `Fish` could suddenly walk :D

```cs
class Animal{} // walk, breathe
class Aquatic : Animal {} // swim (walk, breathe)
class Fish : Aquatic {} // -- (swim, walk, breathe)
class Dog : Aquatic{} // -- (swim, walk, breathe)
class Bird : Animal{} // fly (walk, breathe)
```

### Syntax

- Through Inheritance, it is possible to have a new class Inherit Members from an existing class
- The Base class (parent)
  - Is the class that is inherited FROM
- The Derived class (child)
  - Is the class that is inheriting

```cs
public class DerivedClass : BaseClass 
{
   // derived-class-body
}
```

### Inheriting Instance Members

- The derived class contains both its own Members (fields, methods, properties)
- As well as its parentâ€˜s Members (fields, methods, properties)
- You say, that `Dog` inherits from `Animal`
- Or that `Dog` IS AN `Animal`

#### Methods

The derived class contains both its own methods as well as its parent's methods:

```cs
public class Animal {
   public void Breathe() {
      Console.WriteLine("I'm breathing.");
   }
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
   public void Bark() {
      Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
   }
}
```

Now let's see the `Animal`-class in Action:
```cs
Animal animal = new Animal();
animal.Breathe(); // I'm breathing.

// animal.Bark(); ERROR: Animal does not contain a Member named `Bark`
```

And the `Dog`:
```cs
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.bark(); // Woof!
dog.Breathe(); // I'm breathing.
```

It can even invoke it's parent's methods:

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
   public void Bark() {
      // we need to breathe before we bark loudly
      Breathe();
      Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
   }
}
```

#### Properties (and Fields)

The inheriting class also inherits its parent's properties:

```cs
public class Animal {
   public int Age {get;set;}
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){
    Age = age;
  }

  public void Bark() {
    Console.WriteLine($"I'm {Age} years old, but I can bark!");
  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(2);
dog.Bark();
Console.WriteLine(dog.Age);
```

Output:
```
I'm 2 years old, but I can bark!
2
```

### Inheriting Static Members

Derived classes inherit their parent's static members as well:

```cs
public class Employee {
  public static int TotalCount {get; set;}
  public static void Sign(){
    Console.WriteLine("Employee signed.");
  }
  public static void Quit(){
    Console.WriteLine("Employee Quit.");
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Programmer : Employee {}
```

You can access static members both through the derived class Name as well as the parent class name:

```cs
Employee.Sign(); // Employee signed.
Programmer.Sign(); // Employee signed.
```

Static Member Properties are shared between all classes inheriting from the base class. Including the base class itself:

```cs
Employee.Sign(); // Employee signed.
Console.WriteLine(Employee.Count); // 1
Console.WriteLine(Programmer.Count); // 1
Programmer.Sign(); // Employee signed.
Console.WriteLine(Employee.Count); // 2
Console.WriteLine(Programmer.Count); // 2
```

Output:
```
Employee signed.
1
1
Employee signed.
2
2
```

The inheriting classes can also access the static Members without prefixing the Class-Name:

```cs
public class Programmer {
  public Programmer(){
    Employee.Sign(); // works
    Programmer.Sign(); // works
    Sign(); // works, too!
  }
}
```

```cs
Programmer programmer = new Programmer();
```

Output:
```
Employee signed.
Employee signed.
Employee signed.
```


### Providing a Base-Constructor

Inheriting classes need to provide a compatible constructor to their base class.

```cs
public class Animal {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Animal(int age){
    Age = age;
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age) : base(age){

  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(2);
Console.WriteLine(dog.Age);
```

Output:
```
2
```

The base class always gets constructed first:

```cs
public class Animal {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Animal(int age){
    Console.WriteLine("Animal gets constructed.");
    Age = age;
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age) : base(age){
    Console.WriteLine("Dog gets constructed.");
    Age = 5;
  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(2);
Console.WriteLine(dog.Age);
```

Output:
```
Animal gets constructed.
Dog gets constructed.
5
```

If you don't provide a constructor, your code won't compile!

```cs
public class Animal {
  public int Age {get; set;}
  public Animal(int age){
    Age = age;
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
}
// ERROR: Base class 'Animal' does not contain parameter-less constructor
```


A parameter-less constructor does not need to be explicitly invoked:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public Animal(){
    Console.WriteLine("Animal got constructed.");
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Dog{
  public Dog(){
    Console.WriteLine("Dog got constructed.");
  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog();
```

Output:
```
Animal got constructed.
Dog got constructed.
```

### Encapsulation

Inheriting classes can not access the parent's class's private members:

```cs
public class Animal{
  private int Age{get;set;}
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){
    //Age = age; // ERROR: Cannot access private member
  }
}
```

#### Making it public?

You could fix this by making the parent Member public:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public int Age{get;set;}
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){
    Age = age;
  }
}
```

But that defeats the purpose of Encapsulation. Now, any class can change the `Age`-Property:

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(3);
dog.Age = 5;
```

#### protected

By using `protected`, you can mark a Member to be inaccessible by other classes, but still accessible by all inheriting classes:

```cs
public class Animal{
  protected int Age{get;set;}
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){
    Age = age; // WORKS NOW!
  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(3);
//dog.Age = 5; ERROR: Can not access protected Member.
//Console.WriteLine(dog.Age); ERROR: Can not access protected Member.
```

To make above example a bit more useful, we could change the Property to be `public` but have a `protected` setter:

```cs
public class Animal{
  public int Age{get; protected set;}
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public Dog(int age){
    Age = age; // WORKS STILL!
  }
}
```

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog(3);
Console.WriteLine(dog.Age); // WORKS NOW!
//dog.Age = 5; ERROR: protected get Accessor is not accessible.
```

### sealed

Classes marked with the `sealed` Keyword can not be inherited from.
- this can improve performance slightly
- and can prevent misuse of your classes

```cs
public sealed class Animal {
  public void Live() {
    Console.WriteLine("I'm a living animal.");
  }
}
```

```cs
// ERROR: Cannot inherit from sealed class Animal
public class Dog : Animal { }
```

### No Multiple Inheritance

- By the way:
  - In C#, Classes can only inherit from one class at a time
  
  
```cs
// a class for swim and underwater breathing
public class AquaticAnimal { }
```

```cs
// a class for mammal breeding logic
public class Mammal { }
```

```cs
// ERROR: the dolphin cannot inherit from both classes at the same time :(
public class Dolphin : AquaticAnimal, Mammal { } 
```

## 10. Polymorphism 

### Reminder: Types in Binary

Remember, that all our data is stored in RAM as Binary Numbers?

e.g.

```cs
byte b = 11;
```

Would be stored as:

```
0000 1011
```

And that in order to read our data from Memory correctly, we need to know, where to find the data:

```
...
0110 1110 | Address 1247
0000 1011 | Address 1248
0111 1101 | Address 1249
0101 0001 | Address 1250
0000 0000 | Address 1251
...
```

But also, what type the data has:

- A `byte` at address 1248 has the numeric value `12`.
- A `bool` at address 1248 has the boolean value `true`
- A `char` at address 1248 has the character value `\n` (new line)
- An `int` at address 1248 has the numeric value `5340427`

### Class representation

Considering the following two classes:

```cs
public class Animal {
  public int Age;
  public bool IsHungry;
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal {
  public string Name;
  public int BonesEaten;
}
```

An instance of Type `Dog` has both the members of a `Dog` as well as an `Animal`.

```cs
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.Name = "Bello";
dog.BonesEaten = 123;
dog.Age = 7;
dog.IsHungry = true;
```

In Memory on the Heap, it looks like this:

|Member Name|Memory Offset|  Size |   Value    |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|
|Age        | 0 Bytes     |4 Bytes| 7 |
|IsHungry   | 4 Bytes     |1 Byte | True |
|Name       | 5 Bytes     |8 Bytes| 64-Bit Pointer to string "Bello" |
|BonesEaten | 13 Bytes    |4 Bytes| 123 |

Or in Binary (assuming Little-Endian, or least significant byte first):

|Member Name|Memory Offset|  Size |   Value    |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|
|Age        | 0 Bytes     |4 Bytes| 0000 0111 |
|           | 1 Byte      |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 2 Bytes     |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 3 Bytes     |       | 0000 0000 |
|IsHungry   | 4 Bytes     |1 Byte | 0000 0001 |
|Name       | 5 Bytes     |8 Bytes| ???? ???? |
|           | 6 Bytes     |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 7 Bytes     |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 8 Bytes     |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 9 Bytes     |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 10 Bytes    |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 11 Bytes    |       | ???? ???? |
|           | 12 Bytes    |       | ???? ???? |
|BonesEaten | 13 Bytes    |4 Bytes| 0111 1011 |
|           | 14 Bytes    |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 15 Bytes    |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 16 Bytes    |       | 0000 0000 |

You can see, that the Base Class and its Members come first and the Inherited Members are just put behind that in Memory.

Does that have a reason, or is it pure coincidence?

### Advantage of the Memory Layout

If you look very closely, then you will see that at the address of `Dog dog`, you find the members of class `Animal` first:

|Member Name|Memory Offset|  Size |   Value    |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|
|Age        | 0 Bytes     |4 Bytes| 0000 0111 |
|           | 1 Byte      |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 2 Bytes     |       | 0000 0000 |
|           | 3 Bytes     |       | 0000 0000 |
|IsHungry   | 4 Bytes     |1 Byte | 0000 0001 |

Which means, that if you assume to find an instance of class `Animal` at the address of `Dog dog`, you will find the correct values `Age` and `IsHungry`. In other words, you actually find an `Animal` there!

### In Code

- The derived class can be act as base class as well.
- In this case, a `Dog` can be used as an `Animal` as well.

Which means, that you can pass a `Dog` into a method that requires an `Animal` as an argument:
```cs
public void Pet(Animal animal) { }
```
```cs
Dog dog = new Dog();
Pet(dog);
```

And you can assign a `Dog` to a variable of type `Animal`
    - every `Dog` is an `Animal`...
```cs
Dog dog = new Dog();
Animal animal = dog;
```

But you cannot assign `Animal` to a variable of type `Dog` 
    - not every `Animal` is a `Dog`
    
```cs
Animal animal = new Dog();
Dog dog = animal;
```

You can cast an `Animal` to a `Dog`, though, but more on that later:
   - Note: you will get Errors like `null`, if you're trying to cast an `Animal` to a `Dog`, if it's actually a `Cat`...
```cs
Animal animal = new Dog();
Dog dog = animal as Dog;
```

Let's have a look at the previous example again:
```cs
public class Animal {
   public void Live() {
      Console.WriteLine("I'm a living animal.");
   }
}

// class Dog inherits from Animal - therefore, it also has a Live()-method
public class Dog : Animal {
   // Additionally, we define a Bark()-Method
   public void Bark() {
      Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
   }
}
```

How does this behave with Polymorphism?

```cs
// You can assign a class to it's base class
Animal dog2 = new Dog();
// outputs: "I'm a living animal."
dog2.Live();

// but now, it can not bark anymore
// as we only know for sure, that it's an Animal
dog2.Bark();
```

### Virtualization


If both `Animal` and `Dog` define the same method, it comes to weird behavior, though:

```cs
public class Animal {
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("<AnimalSound>");
  }
}

public class Dog : Animal {
  // warning: the keyword "new" is required on MakeSound 
  // because it hides inherited method Animal.MakeSound()
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
}
```

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal animal = new Animal();
  // output: "<AnimalSound>"
  Dog dog = new Dog();
  // output: "Woof!"
  dog.MakeSound();
  // valid: a dog is an animal
  Animal.animalDog = dog;
  // output: "<AnimalSound>"
  animalDog.MakeSound();
}
```

- To avoid this weird behavior, you can mark Properties or Methods as `virtual`
- `virtual` methods can be overridden by derived classes using the `override` keyword
- You can call the `base`-Method from within an `override` by using the `base`-Keyword


```cs
public class Animal {
  public virtual void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("<AnimalSound>");
  }
}

public class Dog : Animal {
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
}

public class Cat : Animal {
  public override void MakeSound() {
    base.MakeSound();
    Console.WriteLine("Meow!");
  }
}
```

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal[] animals = {new Animal(), new Dog(), new Cat()};
  // Output: 
  // Animal: "<AnimalSound>"
  // Dog: "Woof!"
  // Cat: "<AnimalSound>" & "Meow!"
  foreach ( Animal animal in animals) {
    animal.MakeSound();
  }
}
```

- How to work with `virtual` and `override` and `base`?
- Mark methods as virtual, if you expect inheriting classes to override them
- Virtual methods and properties have to be public or protected (if not, then the deriving class cannot see or use them)
- You should actually **ALWAYS** call the `base` Method as well
- But there is very rare occasions, where you do not want to
- _(But that is a HACK and might break at some point)
